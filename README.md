# Dijkstra_SSSP

Submission for Amazon Coding Challenge - Madrid, 2019.

Given the metro lines of Madrid and data about trips taken with the metro, find the top five most visited metro stations. The trips are defined by their starting and ending metro stations, and the trip assumes that travellers always take the shortest path between these station.

The implementation uses ***Dijkstra algorithms*** to solve the ***Single Source Shortest Path problem*** for each trip, and then sums up station visits.
